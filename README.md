# NLP Workflow for Text Data: Preprocessing, Classification, and Topic Modeling

This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on text data. It includes data preprocessing, sentiment classification using traditional ML models and transformer-based models, and topic modeling using LDA and NMF.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Chapter 1: Text Preprocessing**
  - Removal of punctuation, numbers, and stop words
  - Conversion to lowercase
  - Lemmatization and spelling correction using `spaCy` and `pyspellchecker`

- **Chapter 2: Text Classification using Traditional ML**
  - Bag-of-Words feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`
  - Classification models: Random Forest, Bagging, KNN, AdaBoost
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve

- **Chapter 3: Classification with Transformers**
  - Fine-tuned `BERT-base` and `RoBERTa-base` using Hugging Face Transformers
  - Data tokenization and encoding
  - Training with PyTorch `Trainer`
  - Evaluation with confusion matrix and ROC AUC

- **Chapter 4: Topic Modeling**
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using `gensim`
  - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) using `sklearn`
  - Visualization with `pyLDAvis`

## üìä Performance Summary

| Model      | Accuracy |
